# Daily Programmer

This is a repository for solutions to problems proposed by either 
<https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer> or by some other medium. Most of the 
contained problems are have a small scope, usually only requiring a single 
module as a solution. 

## DailyProgrammer

The three directories inside the "DailyProgrammer" directory, labeled "easy",
"intermediate", and "hard", are the primary categories on [the Daily Programmer
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer). Each subdirectory under one
of these is labeled by the convention "C[challenge#]-[ChallengeName]".

## Foo-Bar

The "foobar" directory contains challenges that were given to me by Google's
recruitment beta, "foobar." I completed three of the five challenges, but the
beta crashed so I was unable to complete all five. Most of the solutions are
currently undocumented but may be at a later date. Some of the solutions have
postmortems which evaluate how bad my speed-code was.

## CodeWars

The "CodeWars" directory contains challenges that were completed on
CodeWars.com.

## DailyPython

The "DailyPython" directory contains various Python projects for miscellaneous
challenges that do not fit into any of the above categories.
