# Daily Programmer

This is a repository for solutions to problems proposed by either <http://www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer> or by some other medium. Most of the contained problems are have a small scope, usually only requiring a single module as a solution.

### Organization

The three directories, labeled "easy", "intermediate", and "hard", are the primary categories on the Daily Programmer subreddit. Each subdirectory under one of these is labeled by the convention "C[challenge#]-[ChallengeName]".

The directory labelled "foobar" contains challenges that were given to me by Google's recruitment beta, "foobar." I completed three of the five challenges, but the beta crashed, so I was unable to complete all five. The solutions are currently undocumented, but may be at a later date.
