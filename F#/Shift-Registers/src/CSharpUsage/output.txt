This small project demonstrates interoperability between F# and C#.

Creating a new shift register, which is type defined in an F# project.
Calling the ShiftRegister's ToString() -> '0x0123456789ABCDEF'

Lists have some interesting interoperability.
Looping through XOR LFSR until a duplicate value is found...
