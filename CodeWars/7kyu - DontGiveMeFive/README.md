# Don't give me five! (7 kyu)

In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and 
should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The 
number range is inclusive. 

Examples: 

```
1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
```

The result may contain fives. The start number will always be smaller than the 
end number. Both numbers can be also negative!
