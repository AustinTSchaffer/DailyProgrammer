# Roman Numerals

Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a 
string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer. 

Create another function which can go back the other way.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting 
with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. In Roman 
numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is 
written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman symbol in 
descending order: MDCLXVI.

|	------	|	-----	|

| V      	|    5		|
| X      	|    10		|
| L      	|    50		|
| C      	|    100	|
| D      	|    500	|
| M      	|    1,000	|
