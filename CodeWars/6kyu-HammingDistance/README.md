# Hamming Distance (6 kyu)

## Task

The hamming distance between a pair of numbers is the number of binary bits 
that differ in their binary notation. 

## Example 

For a = 25, b= 87, the result should be 4

25: 00011001
87: 01010111

The hamming distance between these two would be 4 (bits 2, 5, 6, and 7). 

## Input/Output

    [input] integer a

    First Number. 1 <= a <= 2^20

    [input] integer b

    Second Number. 1 <= b <= 2^20

    [output] an integer
