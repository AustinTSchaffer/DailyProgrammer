# Interview Challenges

## GDELT-Event-Data-Processor

Data pipeline project, completed for S&P Global in Charlottesville, VA.

## Terraform-Example-Project

"Set up a container on an EC2 in AWS" deployment project using Terraform,
completed for ESG (Merkle Inc.) in Charlottesville, VA.

## Foo-Bar

The "foobar" directory contains challenges that were given to me by Google's
recruitment beta, "foobar." I completed three of the five challenges, but the
beta crashed so I was unable to complete all five. Most of the solutions are
currently undocumented but may be at a later date. Some of the solutions have
postmortems which evaluate how bad my speed-code was.
