<h1 id="gdelt-data-pipeline">GDELT Data Pipeline</h1>
<p>This repository contains a Python pipeline that pulls GDELT data from a publicly available stream, maps the data down to a subset of the data’s features, then pushes the data to another service.</p>

<p>The purpose of this application was to create a sample application that had a Flask component and a database component, while also running a</p>
<h2 id="application-flow">Application Flow</h2>
<p>On startup, the application sets up the routes for a Flask app, then uses APScheduler to schedule the data fetch process. The data fetch and upload process does not run right away, so that it does not block the startup of the Flask app.</p>
<p>This application flow has a few tradeoffs and could definitely benefit from using more async and await functionality. It’s possible that a dump of GDELT data will overwhelm the system, causing it to miss the next dump of GDELT data.</p>
<h3 id="flask-app">Flask App</h3>
<p>The Flask component of this application has 4 GET endpoints and 0 POST endpoints.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code>: This endpoint serves a raw HTML file which has links to the other endpoints and information about the author (Austin Schaffer), including GitHub and LinkedIn. This endpoint also serves to show that the application is running, and allows users to navigate.</li>
<li><code>/data</code>: This endpoint shows the data that the application stored in the <code>data</code> table of its MySQL database. The intent of this endpoint is to show all of the data that the application has processed.</li>
<li><code>/files</code>: This endpoint shows the CSV files that the application downloaded and processed along with a boolean flag which shows whether the application was able to successfully process the file.</li>
<li><code>/readme</code>: This endpoint shows a plain HTML version of this README, which was created using <code>pandoc</code> and modified only slightly (to remove image links that I couldn’t get working).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-process">Data Process</h3>
<p>The process that pulls data zipped CSV data and uploads the mapped records to the recipient runs on a timer, 5 mintues by default. This process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pulls down the latest file from http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv2/lastupdate.txt and checks the md5 hash of the <code>export.csv.zip</code> file to make sure that the file has not yet been processed by the app. If the database already contains the hash, then thes process exits early.</li>
<li>Creates a record in the <code>processed_files</code> table of the database for the file, to protect against race conditions and to prevent the file from being uploaded twice.</li>
<li>Downloads the <code>export.csv.zip</code> to a temporary file.</li>
<li>Creates a stream from the zip file so that it can process each row of the CSV one at a time without loading the entire file into memory and without extracting the entire CSV into the file system.</li>
<li>For each record in the CSV, uploads a subset of the record’s fields to the recipient, catches the response, then saves both into the <code>data</code> table of the database. This is the component of the application that would greatly benefit from using <code>asyncio</code> functionality.</li>
<li>Deletes the temporary file, then updates the <code>processed_files</code> table to reflect that the file was processed successfully.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="listening-for-new-data">Listening for New Data</h2>
<p>Getting this component of the application working was my biggest decision point, so I’d like to take the opportunity to expand on it a little bit.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-simple-notification-service-sns">Using the “Simple Notification Service” (SNS)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/gdelt/">AWS Open Data Registry page for GDELT</a> mentions a “Simple Notification Service” (SNS) that posts updates that were made to the S3 bucket that contains the GDELT data. I am unfamiliar with SNS feeds, and most of AWS in general, but I presume that using the SNS would be the best way to make sure that the app only streams the latest data from the GDELT S3 bucket. I initially attempted to subscribe to the provided SNS, but it appears that you need to be given explicit permission to subscribe to the SNS. It is not clear who you need to contact in order to request access.</p>

<p>Just to be sure that the issue was not related to my limited understanding of AWS’s boto3 library, I tried to subscribe my email address to the SNS using the web interface. That route also failed.</p>
<p>For a production application, I would prefer to get the SNS working.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-web-resource-that-has-a-get-endpoint">Using a Web Resource that has a GET Endpoint</h3>
<p>I managed to find <a href="http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv2/lastupdate.txt" class="uri">http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv2/lastupdate.txt</a>, which returns a plaintext resource that contains 3 lines of data:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;file size in bytes&gt; &lt;MD5 hash&gt; &lt;base url&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt;.export.CSV.zip
&lt;file size in bytes&gt; &lt;MD5 hash&gt; &lt;base url&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt;.mentions.CSV.zip
&lt;file size in bytes&gt; &lt;MD5 hash&gt; &lt;base url&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt;.gkg.csv.zip</code></pre>
<p>I was unable to find any documentation on the format of this file, but the order of the 3 ZIP files seems constant, the arrangement of the 3 columns seems constant, and the resource refreshes every 15 minutes.</p>
