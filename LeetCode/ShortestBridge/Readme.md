# Shortest Bridge Problem

Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/

In a given 2D binary array A, there are two islands. (An island is a
4-directionally connected group of 1s not connected to any other 1s.)

Now, we may change 0s to 1s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1
island.

Return the smallest number of 0s that must be flipped. (It is guaranteed that
the answer is at least 1.)
