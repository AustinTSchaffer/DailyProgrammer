# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/547/week-4-july-22nd-july-28th/3398/

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes'
values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and
alternate between).

## Example

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its zigzag level order traversal as:

```
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```
